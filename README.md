# Project Delta
Project Delta is an attempt to provide Pesto’s instructors visibility into how effectively the student body is learning the curriculum.

- [Students Portal](https://deltapesto.herokuapp.com/)

- [Api Portal](https://deltapesto-api.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Project Delta enables tracking:
1. How confident students are that they have mastered topics covered in the lectures
2. Student's performance in exercises

… and presenting instructors with visualizations that will allow easy identification of:
1. Struggling students
2. Insufficiently-explained topics
3. Unreasonably difficult exercises
